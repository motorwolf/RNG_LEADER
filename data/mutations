Long Arms|Your arms can telescope to ten times the length of a typical human being. This means that you can generally attack an enemy before it can attack you.
Superior Vision|Your vision is twenty times that of an average human. This means that you have an extra chance to evade battles before they begin.
Poisonous Tentacles|You have some bonus appendages that ooze a toxin. This toxin can occasionally poison your enemies.
Porky Man|Occasionally, you turn into a porky man. This means that you cannot move for a single turn.
